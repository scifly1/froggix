Frogger.

To run type 'python frogger.py' at the command line, from the directory containing this file.

Aim:
To accumulate points by moving frogs safely across the road and river and into their 'homes'.  Use the arrow keys to move and avoid being squashed by the vehicles, drowning in the river and being eaten by the crocodile.  Collect flies for bonus points and get a time bonus by getting frogs home quickly.  Only a single frog can live in each home and frogs cannot live in a home containing the remains of a frog eaten by a crocodile.  If you get any frogs home you can continue on to the next level(s), which are faster and for which the available time is decreased.

Points:
Hop Forward		10 points
Eat a Fly			100 points
Get a frog home	250 points
Time bonus 		up to 1000 points

Enjoy!
