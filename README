Froggix.

Froggix is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. The aim is to gain points by getting frogs safely across a busy road and a treacherous river to their homes.

Use the arrow keys to move and avoid being squashed by the vehicles, drowning in the river and being eaten by the crocodile.  Collect flies for bonus points and get a time bonus by getting frogs home quickly.  
Only a single frog can live in each home and frogs cannot live in a home containing the remains of a frog eaten by a crocodile.  If you get any frogs home you can continue on to the next level(s), which are faster and for which the available time is decreased.

Points:
Hop Forward		10 points
Eat a Fly			100 points
Get a frog home	250 points
Time bonus 		up to 1000 points


Running the game:
This game is written in python and uses the pygame modules.  These are available for linux (search your package manager), Windows and Mac (download from python.org/download and http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

I had a report that setting pygame up on a Mac could be difficult (Thanks John Kirby).  The blog at :
http://geoffford.wordpress.com/2009/01/20/pygame-on-os-x-leopard/
was helpful to him, so I hope it can be of use to others.
 
In Linux: type 'python froggix.py' at a command line, from the directory containing this file.

In Windows just click on the froggix.py file.

In Mac OS X, either run from the command line as with Linux, or drag the froggix.py file to PythonLauncher from the Finder or select PythonLancher as the default application to open the froggix.py file through the Info window and double-click it.

This game is playable but is still being improved/fixed, so, if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements or any patches, please contact me by email at the address at the top of this file or through the forum or bug tracker on the game's sourceforge pages http://sourceforge.net/projects/froggix/ .

I hope you enjoy the game!
