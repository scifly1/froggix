Froggix is a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. The aim is to gain points by getting frogs safely across a busy road and a treacherous river to their homes.

Use the arrow keys to move and avoid being squashed by the vehicles, drowning in the river and being eaten by the crocodile.  Collect flies for bonus points and get a time bonus by getting frogs home quickly.  
Only a single frog can live in each home and frogs cannot live in a home containing the remains of a frog eaten by a crocodile.  If you get any frogs home you can continue on to the next level(s), which are faster and for which the available time is decreased.

Points:
Hop Forward		10 points
Eat a Fly			100 points
Get a frog home	250 points
Time bonus 		up to 1000 points


Running the game:

This game is playable but is still being improved/fixed, so, if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements or any patches, please contact me by email at the address at the top of this file or through the forum or bug tracker on the game's sourceforge pages http://sourceforge.net/projects/froggix/ .
